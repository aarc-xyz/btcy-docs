## What is BTCY?

**BTCY** is an ERC-4626 vault token that wraps iBTCY for use in DeFi protocols.

Each BTCY token is backed 1:1 by iBTCY in the vault. BTCY can be freely transferred, traded, and used as collateral—unlike the restricted iBTCY token.

## Key Properties

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Token Type** | ERC-20 (ERC-4626 vault) |
| **Backing** | 1:1 with iBTCY |
| **Transferability** | Unrestricted |
| **Eligibility** | Anyone can hold BTCY |

## Why BTCY?

iBTCY is a regulated security token with transfer restrictions. While this provides compliance, it limits DeFi composability.

BTCY solves this by creating a wrapper that:

- **Preserves backing** — Always 1:1 with iBTCY
- **Enables composability** — Standard ERC-20, works anywhere
- **Maintains yield** — Value accrues from underlying fund
