## Overview

BTCY uses **role-based access control** to separate privileges and prevent single points of failure.

---

## Roles

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` | Manage other roles, critical admin functions |
| `COMPLIANCE_ROLE` | Manage allowlist and blocklist |
| `PAUSER_ROLE` | Pause/unpause contract operations |
| `UPGRADER_ROLE` | Upgrade contract implementations |
| `MANAGER_ADMIN_ROLE` | Configure operational parameters |
| `REQUESTER_ROLE` | Submit mint/redeem requests |
| `PROCESSOR_ROLE` | Process mint/redeem requests |
| `RESCUER_ROLE` | Rescue stuck tokens |

## Checking Roles

```solidity
// Check if address has role
bool hasRole = contract.hasRole(COMPLIANCE_ROLE, address);

// Grant role (admin only)
contract.grantRole(COMPLIANCE_ROLE, address);

// Revoke role (admin only)  
contract.revokeRole(COMPLIANCE_ROLE, address);
```
