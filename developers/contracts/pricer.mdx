# Pricer Contract

*This page is a placeholder. The Pricer contract documentation will be added when the contract is finalized.*

## Overview

The Pricer contract may be used to:

- Aggregate NAV price feeds
- Provide fallback pricing logic
- Handle price smoothing or TWAP

## Current Implementation

NAV pricing is currently handled directly in IBTCYHub via Chainlink oracle integration.

See [Oracle & Pricing](/developers/architecture/oracle-pricing) for current implementation details.

## Future Considerations

A dedicated Pricer contract may be introduced for:

- Multi-source price aggregation
- More sophisticated price validation
- Cross-chain price feeds
