## The Two-Token System

BTCY uses a two-token design that separates institutional compliance requirements from DeFi functionality.

## iBTCY — The Institutional Layer

**iBTCY** is a NAV-based security token representing ownership in Sygnum's BTC yield fund.

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Structure** | Swiss Actively Managed Certificate (AMC) |
| **Pricing** | Net Asset Value, updated daily via oracle |
| **Eligibility** | Qualified investors only (KYC required) |
| **Transferability** | Restricted to allowlisted addresses |
| **Custody** | Sygnum Bank (Switzerland) |

<Info>
iBTCY holders have a direct claim on the underlying fund assets. The token price reflects the NAV of the fund, not market trading.
</Info>

## BTCY — The DeFi Layer

**BTCY** is an ERC-4626 vault token that wraps iBTCY for DeFi use.

| Property | Detail |
|----------|--------|
| **Backing** | 1:1 with iBTCY |
| **Standard** | ERC-4626 (tokenized vault) |
| **Transferability** | Unrestricted (standard ERC-20) |
| **Use cases** | Collateral, lending, liquidity pools |

<Info>
BTCY can be traded, lent, or used as collateral in any DeFi protocol. To redeem the underlying BTC, unwrap to iBTCY first.
</Info>

## The Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mint iBTCY">
    Deposit BTC with Sygnum. After verification, receive iBTCY at the current NAV price. *Requires KYC.*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wrap to BTCY">
    Deposit iBTCY into the vault. Receive BTCY 1:1. *Instant, no fees.*
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use in DeFi">
    BTCY is a standard ERC-20. Use it anywhere—lending, DEXs, collateral.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Unwrap & Redeem">
    Convert BTCY back to iBTCY, then redeem iBTCY for BTC through Sygnum.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why This Design?

Traditional tokenized securities can't enter DeFi—they require transfer restrictions that break composability.

BTCY solves this by separating concerns:

- **iBTCY** handles compliance (KYC, allowlist, regulatory requirements)
- **BTCY** handles composability (unrestricted transfers, DeFi integration)

The result: institutional-grade yield that works in permissionless protocols.
