# Fee Structure

BTCY maintains a simple, transparent fee structure.

## Current Fees

| Fee Type | Rate | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Subscription (Mint)** | 0% | No fee to convert BTC → iBTCY |
| **Instant Redemption** | 0.1% (10 bps) | Fee for T+0/T+1 redemption |
| **Monthly Redemption** | 0% | No fee for standard redemption |
| **Wrap (iBTCY → BTCY)** | 0% | No fee to wrap |
| **Unwrap (BTCY → iBTCY)** | 0% | No fee to unwrap |

<Info>
  Maximum allowed fee is **1% (100 bps)**, hardcoded in the contract. Current fees are well below this cap.
</Info>

## Fee Details

### Instant Redemption Fee

The 0.1% fee on instant redemptions serves to:

1. **Replenish the sleeve** - Maintains liquidity for future instant redemptions
2. **Discourage arbitrage** - Prevents rapid in/out movements
3. **Compensate liquidity** - Rewards the fund for maintaining liquid reserves

**Example:**
- Redeeming 100 iBTCY instantly at NAV 1.05
- Gross BTC: 105 BTC
- Fee (0.1%): 0.105 BTC
- Net received: 104.895 BTC

### Where Fees Go

Fees are retained in the fund's "sleeve" (liquid reserve), benefiting all token holders indirectly.

## Fee Changes

Fee changes require `MANAGER_ADMIN_ROLE` (Ops 2/3 multisig) and are:

- Subject to the 1% maximum cap
- Logged on-chain via `FeeUpdated` event
- Effective immediately upon transaction

```solidity
event FeeUpdated(string feeType, uint256 oldBps, uint256 newBps);
```

## No Hidden Fees

<Check>
  - No management fees
  - No performance fees
  - No withdrawal delays (instant path available)
  - No lock-up periods
</Check>

## Gas Costs

Users pay standard Ethereum gas fees for:

- Requesting subscriptions/redemptions
- Wrapping/unwrapping BTCY
- Token transfers

<Note>
  Gas costs vary with network congestion. Consider timing transactions during lower-fee periods.
