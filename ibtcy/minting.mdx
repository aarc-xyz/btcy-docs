## Processing Paths

| Path | When | Timeline | Fee |
|------|------|----------|-----|
| **Instant** | Sleeve has capacity | T+0 to T+1 | 0% |
| **Queued** | Exceeds sleeve | Monthly dealing window | 0% |

<Info>
  The "sleeve" is ~32% of AUM kept liquid for instant processing. Large subscriptions may be partially instant, partially queued.
</Info>

## NAV Calculation

At time of processing:

```
iBTCY Amount = BTC Amount / Current NAV
```

**Example:**
- BTC sent: 100 BTC
- Current NAV: 1.05 BTC per iBTCY
- iBTCY received: 100 / 1.05 = **95.24 iBTCY**

## Request States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pending** | Request created, awaiting processing |
| **Partially Processed** | Some amount processed, remainder pending |
| **Completed** | Fully processed, iBTCY minted |
| **Cancelled** | Cancelled by admin (BTC refunded off-chain) |

## Cancellation

<Note>
  **Users cannot cancel subscriptions** because BTC has already been sent off-chain. Only admins can cancel (e.g., for compliance issues), and BTC will be refunded.
</Note>

## Tracking Your Request

View your subscription status in the BTCY app dashboard or query on-chain:

```solidity
// Get subscription details
IBTCYHub.getSubscriptionRequest(requestId);

// Get all your subscriptions
IBTCYHub.getUserSubscriptions(yourAddress);
```
