## What is iBTCY?

**iBTCY** is a NAV-based security token representing ownership in Sygnum Bank's actively managed BTC yield fund.

Each iBTCY token represents a proportional claim on the fund's assets. The token price reflects the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the underlying fund, not market trading.

## How NAV Pricing Works

Unlike market-traded tokens, iBTCY price is determined by the underlying fund's NAV:

1. **Daily calculation** — NAV is calculated based on fund assets
2. **Oracle update** — Price is published on-chain via Chainlink
3. **Mint/redeem pricing** — All operations use the current NAV

<Info>
This means iBTCY price reflects actual fund performance, not market speculation.
