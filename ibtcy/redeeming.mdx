# Redeeming iBTCY

Convert your iBTCY tokens back to BTC through the redemption process.

## Prerequisites

<Check>
  - Hold iBTCY in your wallet
  - Minimum $100,000 USD equivalent
  - Not blocklisted
</Check>

## Redemption Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Request Redemption">
    Call `requestRedemption()` or use the BTCY app
    
    Your iBTCY is transferred to the Hub as escrow
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose Path">
    Select **Instant** (0.1% fee) or **Monthly** (0% fee)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Processing">
    Backend processes at current NAV:
    
    ```
    BTC received = iBTCY amount × NAV - fees
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Receive BTC">
    BTC sent to your registered address off-chain
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Redemption Paths

| Path | Timeline | Fee | When Used |
|------|----------|-----|-----------|
| **Instant** | T+0 to T+1 | 0.1% (10 bps) | Sleeve has liquidity |
| **Monthly** | Next dealing window | 0% | Sleeve depleted |

<Info>
  The 0.1% instant fee helps replenish the liquid sleeve, ensuring fast redemptions remain available.
</Info>

## Partial Processing

Large redemptions may be processed in chunks:

```
Request: 100 iBTCY
├── Process 1: 50 iBTCY (instant)
└── Process 2: 50 iBTCY (monthly)
```

Track progress via `amountProcessed` in your request.

## Cancellation

### User Cancellation

You can cancel **within 2 hours** of requesting:

```solidity
IBTCYHub.cancelRedemption(redemptionId);
```

Your escrowed iBTCY will be returned.

### Admin Cancellation

Admins can cancel anytime (e.g., for compliance). Tokens are returned unless you're blocklisted.

<Warning>
  If blocklisted during redemption, your tokens may be recovered to the compliance treasury by Cold 3/5 multisig.
</Warning>

## NAV Calculation

At time of processing:

```
BTC Amount = iBTCY Amount × Current NAV - Fee
```

**Example (Instant):**
- iBTCY redeemed: 100 iBTCY
- Current NAV: 1.05 BTC per iBTCY
- Gross BTC: 100 × 1.05 = 105 BTC
- Fee (0.1%): 0.105 BTC
- Net BTC received: **104.895 BTC**

## Request States

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Pending** | iBTCY escrowed, awaiting processing |
| **Partially Processed** | Some processed, remainder pending |
| **Completed** | Fully processed, BTC sent |
| **Cancelled** | Cancelled, iBTCY returned (if not blocklisted) |

## Tracking Your Request

```solidity
// Get redemption details
IBTCYHub.getRedemptionRequest(redemptionId);

// Get all your redemptions
IBTCYHub.getUserRedemptions(yourAddress);

// Check total escrowed in hub
IBTCYHub.getTotalEscrowed();
```
