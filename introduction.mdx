# Welcome to BTCY

BTCY is an institutional two-token system that brings **regulated Bitcoin yield** to DeFi. Built by [Aarc](https://aarc.xyz), BTCY bridges the gap between traditional finance and decentralized protocols.

  <Card title="iBTCY" icon="building-columns">
    Institutional token backed by Sygnum's BTC yield fund. KYC required, NAV-based pricing.
  </Card>
  <Card title="BTCY" icon="coins">
    DeFi wrapper (ERC-4626) for iBTCY. 1:1 backed, composable with any DeFi protocol.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Why BTCY?

| Challenge | BTCY Solution |
|-----------|---------------|
| Bitcoin doesn't earn yield | Backed by Sygnum's actively managed BTC yield fund (~5% APY) |
| Institutional products can't enter DeFi | Two-token system separates compliance from composability |
| Regulatory uncertainty | Swiss AMC structure with BMA-licensed custody |
| Complex onboarding | Simple wrap/unwrap between institutional and DeFi layers |

## How It Works

```
USER sends BTC ──► SYGNUM ──► HUB mints ──► USER gets iBTCY
                                                │
                              ┌─────────────────┘
                              ▼
                    iBTCY ◄──► BTCY Vault ◄──► DeFi Protocols
```

1. **Mint iBTCY**: Send BTC to custody, receive iBTCY at NAV price
2. **Wrap to BTCY**: Deposit iBTCY into vault, receive BTCY 1:1
3. **Use in DeFi**: BTCY works like any ERC-20 (lending, DEX, collateral)
4. **Unwrap & Redeem**: Convert back when you need BTC
