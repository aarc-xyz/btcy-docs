</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between iBTCY and BTCY?">
  - **iBTCY**: Institutional token, KYC required, allowlist-restricted transfers, NAV-based pricing
  - **BTCY**: DeFi wrapper, no KYC for transfers, 1:1 backed by iBTCY, works like any ERC-20
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What yield can I expect?">
  The underlying fund targets approximately 5% APY through Bitcoin yield strategies. This is reflected in the growing NAV of iBTCY.

## Wrapping & Unwrapping
