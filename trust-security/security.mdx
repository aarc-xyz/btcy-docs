# Security Model

BTCY is built with institutional-grade security at every layer.

## Smart Contract Security

### Access Control

All contracts use role-based access control with multiple signers:

| Role | Holder | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `DEFAULT_ADMIN` | Cold 3/5 multisig | Role management, upgrades |
| `UPGRADER` | Cold 3/5 multisig | Propose contract upgrades |
| `COMPLIANCE` | Ops 2/3 multisig | Allowlist/blocklist management |
| `PROCESSOR` | Ops 2/3 multisig | Process mint/redeem requests |
| `PAUSER` | Any admin (1/N) | Emergency pause |

### Timelocks

Contract upgrades are protected by timelocks:

- **Normal upgrades**: 48-hour delay
- **Emergency upgrades**: 12-hour delay

<Info>
  During the timelock period, `DEFAULT_ADMIN` can cancel a proposed upgrade if issues are discovered.
</Info>

### Circuit Breakers

Automatic protection against large, potentially malicious operations:

| Trigger | Threshold | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Large mint | > 50% of supply | Auto-pause |
| Large redeem | > 40% of supply | Auto-pause |
| Single operation | > 10% of supply | Revert (no pause) |

### Reentrancy Protection

All state-changing functions use OpenZeppelin's `ReentrancyGuard`.

## Oracle Security

NAV pricing uses Chainlink oracles with multiple safety checks:

```solidity
require(answer > 0, "Price is zero");
require(updatedAt > 0, "Round incomplete");
require(answeredInRound >= roundId, "Stale round");
require(block.timestamp - updatedAt < 48 hours, "Oracle stale");
```

### Staleness Handling

| Oracle Age | Behavior |
|------------|----------|
| < 24 hours | ✅ Use new price |
| 24-48 hours | ⚠️ Use last valid price, emit warning |
| > 48 hours | ❌ Block all operations |

### Price Bounds

- **Minimum NAV**: 0.5 BTC (hardcoded floor)
- **Maximum deviation**: 5% per update

## Compliance Controls

### Blocklist
- Checked **first** on all operations (fail fast)
- Blocklisted addresses cannot send, receive, or interact

### Allowlist
- Required for iBTCY transfers
- Required for BTCY withdrawals (unwrap)

## Emergency Procedures

### Pause Capabilities

| Contract | Pause Scope |
|----------|-------------|
| iBTCY | All transfers |
| IBTCYHub | Subscriptions, Redemptions, Processing (granular) |
| BTCY Vault | Deposits, Withdrawals |

<Warning>
  **Cancel functions always work**, even when paused. Users can always cancel pending redemptions within the grace period.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

1. **Use hardware wallets** for holding iBTCY/BTCY
2. **Verify contract addresses** before interacting
3. **Monitor events** for large operations via our dashboard
4. **Report issues** to security@aarc.xyz
