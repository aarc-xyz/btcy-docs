## Access Control

All privileged operations require specific roles:

| Role | Capability |
|------|------------|
| **Admin** | Manage roles, upgrade contracts (timelocked) |
| **Compliance** | Manage allowlist/blocklist |
| **Pauser** | Emergency pause operations |
| **Processor** | Process mint/redeem requests |

<Info>
No single role can perform all operations. Critical actions require multiple roles or timelocks.
</Info>

## Operational Security

- **Multi-signature wallets** for all admin operations
- **Timelocked upgrades** — changes are announced before execution
- **Oracle validation** — price data is validated for staleness and bounds
- **Circuit breakers** — automatic pauses on unusual activity

---

## Oracle Security

NAV pricing relies on Chainlink oracles with multiple safeguards:

- **Staleness checks** — stale data is rejected
- **Price bounds** — extreme values are flagged
- **Fallback mechanisms** — graceful degradation if oracles fail
